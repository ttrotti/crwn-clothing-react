I built this project by following the Complete React Developer in 2020 course on Udemy.
Some of the technologies I integrated are: React, Redux, Firebase, Stripe payments & Sass.

I'll continue to add features and explore possibilities in this project, you can find it deployed at https://ttrotti-crwn-clothing-app.herokuapp.com/
